This Event-B system is based on a model that appeared in the book:
System Modelling & Design Using Event-B by Ken Robinson.

It illustrates how a an abstract machine describes
the consistency of a single bank account. The refinement
then add multiple membership accounts while still
maintaining the single bank account.

It also illustrates the use of a witness to drop (or replace)
a variable when refining an event.
