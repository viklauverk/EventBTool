Event-B performs type checking of formulas and variables. Within evbt
these types are called checked types. Such checked types can be used for
implementing a variable but they have neither limits on integers nor
restrictions on the sets. Thus the generated code is not very efficient.

Therefore evbt will try to deduce suitable implementation types to be
able use an efficient map for a partial function or a vector for a
full function with a domain 1..100.

If no implementation type can be found, then evbt will fall back
to using the checked type for implementation.
